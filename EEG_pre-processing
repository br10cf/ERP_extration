% This script was put together for exercise purposes, I personally recommend to do the filtering, ICA, IClabel and epoch extration at separable scripts and files, 
just so that if anything goes wrong you can know were to go back and fix. Don't forget to check for data and events consistency as well!

clc 
clear all

directory = ['(insert path for files to be processed)'];
directory_destiny = ['(insert path for saving the processed files)'];

folder = [{'(group1)'};{'(group1'}];

for group = 1:4
    
temp_list = struct2cell(dir([directory filesep folder{group} filesep '*.set'])); % gather all ye .set.
file_list = temp_list(1,:)';

for file = 1:length(file_list)
    
    eeglab
    
    name = char(file_list{file}(1:end-4)) %just to check at the command line which file we are openning
    
    EEG = pop_loadbv(directory, file_list{file}, [], 1:(n. channels)); #check number of channels (we used 31, so it would be 1:31)
    
    EEG = pop_resample(EEG, 250); %resampling so that the process will be faster (freq = Hz)(recommended for EEG: 250Hz)
    
    EEG = pop_reref(EEG, [10, 21]); %re-referencing to TP9 and TP10
    
    % filter data and remove baseline. Applying high-pass filters causes a huge alteration in frequency spectrum, so we used the Clean Line 
    fuction to get rid of the line-noise (in Brazil: 60Hz)
    EEG = pop_eegfiltnew(EEG, 'locutoff',0.5) %low-pass filtering is recommended for filtering movement artifacts
    EEG = pop_cleanline(EEG, 'bandwidth',2,'chanlist',[1:EEG.nbchan] ,'computepower',1,'linefreqs',60,'newversion',0,'normSpectrum',0,'p',0.01,'pad',2,'plotfigures',0,'scanforlines',0,'sigtype','Channels','taperbandwidth',2,'tau',100,'verb',1,'winsize',4,'winstep',1);
    EEG = pop_rmbase( EEG, [],[]);
    
    % Run ICA
    EEG = pop_clean_rawdata(EEG, 'FlatlineCriterion',5,'ChannelCriterion',0.8,'LineNoiseCriterion',4,'Highpass',[0.25 0.75] ,'BurstCriterion',20,'WindowCriterion',0.25,'BurstRejection','on','Distance','Euclidian','WindowCriterionTolerances',[-Inf 7] );
    
    % Run IClabel for automated detection of artifacts (heartbeat, muscle movements, eye-blinks, line-noise and non-brain signals)
    EEG = pop_iclabel(EEG, 'default'); 
    EEG = pop_icflag(EEG, [0.1 0.9;0.1 1;0.1 1;0.1 1;0.1 1;0.1 1;0.1 1]); %classify everything that would not be 90% certain that is brain, to be artifact
    EEG = pop_subcomp( EEG, find(EEG.reject.gcompreject), 0); %remove artifacts components
    
    EEG = pop_saveset( EEG, 'filename',sprintf(strcat(name,'_','pre-processed')),'filepath',[directory_destiny filesep folder{group}]);
    
end
